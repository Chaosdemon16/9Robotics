	  <p>Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm Arlo, a high school student with a love for programing and robotics. When I'm not teaching myself programming, you can find me playing D&D, building robots or competing in Tournament of Minds. This space is where I share my projects, learning, and the things that inspire me.</p>

The back four wheels are omni-wheels that allow the robot to turn in place while the front wheels prevent other teams from pushing us sideways.</p><p class="des">Anklebiter uses a two bar lift powered by two high tourqe motors to lift up a single motor claw mech that is the ideal size to grabs rings and dump them onto stakes, while also being tight enough while closed to lift mobile goals into corners during skills challenges.</p></div>
